## Why use ChatBox?

- Directly using or testing the OpenAI API can be quite challenging, requiring an understanding of programming, and may lack convenience. ChatBox can help you handle all of the underlying things.
- ChatBox also saves all chat messages and prompts locally, preventing data loss in online services.
- ChatBox can help you design, debug, and manage prompts, giving you greater control over the AI interface.

## Alternative to ChatGPT Plus?

The idea is feasible. OpenAI also provides a developer API service, which offers the same functionality as ChatGPT Plus and some additional benefits as follows: 

1. Unlike ChatGPT Plus, which charges a fixed monthly fee of $20, the developer API service charges based on usage, resulting in lower overall costs.
2. The developer API service enables more direct use of the model behind ChatGPT, such as using more flexible prompt role debugging and parameter debugging.
